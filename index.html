	<h2>My Journal</h2>
        <p>*Date: December 18, 2023*</p>
        <p>Today marked another early start on my 
			educational journey.Waking up at 4 am
			has become a routine, a testament to
			my commitment to acquiring knowledge 
			despite the challenges.Living far from 
			school makes each morning a journey, 
			but my determination to be on time fuels
			me. As I embark on the commute, the dimly 
			lit streets hold a quiet anticipation for
            the day ahead. The bus ride is my time to
			prepare mentally for classes, reviewing 
			notes and setting goals. The world is still
            asleep, but my pursuit of education is wide
			awake. Arriving at school feels like a victory
			in itself. The campus comes to life, and I am
			reminded that each step is a stride toward a 
			brighter future. Despite facing various personal
			challenges, the support of my mother keeps me 
			going. Her sacrifices echo in my mind,reinforcing
			the importance of perseverance. In the midst of
            exhaustion, I find strength in knowing that my 
			education is not just for me but for my family. 
			Every lecture, every assignment,and every 
			late-night study session are bricks in the
			foundation of a better life. There's a profound
			sense of purpose that accompanies each day. I 
			push through the fatigue, not just for myself,
			but for the dreams my family has for me. Education
			is my compass, guiding me through challenges, and 
			I am determined to graduate college, turning
			dreams into reality.</p>

		<h2>A Road To Dreams</h2>
		<p>Five years from now, I envision myself as a dedicated
			IT professional in my dream company. Despite the stress
			and pressure that college has brought into my life, I 
			eagerly step into the dynamic world of the IT industry.
			This journey might be intimidating, but it's a path I 
			willingly embrace because it aligns with my dreams 
			and where I truly belong.Entering the IT realm allows 
			me to not only expand my knowledge but also apply the
			skills I've acquired through my education. Even though
			the prospect of venturing into a new field is daunting,
			I find comfort in the idea of moving forward. This is my
			dream, and I'm determined to pursue it, knowing that 
			every step is a step toward a brighter future.The IT 
			industry may present challenges, but I firmly believe 
			that everything happens for a reason. Each obstacle is
			an opportunity to grow, learn, and prove to myself that 
			I can overcome. My journey is fueled by determination, 
			hard work, and self-trust. These qualities become my 
			compass, guiding me through the complexities of the
			IT landscape.Despite the hurdles faced today, I 
			recognize the importance of staying strong to achieve
			my goals. The path I've chosen may be tough, but I am
			convinced that it leads to the realization of my dreams.
			As I navigate through the challenges of the IT industry,
			I hold on to the belief that every difficulty is a 
			stepping stone toward success. The journey is demanding,
			but I am ready to face it head-on, armed with resilience
			and the unwavering belief that my dreams are within reach.</p>
